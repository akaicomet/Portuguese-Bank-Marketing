### 6. Variable Importance Chart and Selection
Selected variables varies from different training classifiers and data transformation. Robust feature engineering variable selection is assumed to gain most "support" from different selections. The very last chart "Total Support Count" is total support summary bar graph to determine variable to be used for building model. However your model building intends to seek for a particular algorithm and you may want to use classifiers algorithm specific variable selection.         

### 7. Correlation
Highly correlated variables should not be included in model. Check and see correlation table.

### 8. Final Variable Selection
With threshold total_cnt = 270, final selected variable are listed here.
